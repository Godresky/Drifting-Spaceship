# Drifting-Spaceship
My short horror game created for Major Jam 4 Cosmic. I developed this game on the Unity 2021.1.13f1 engine, the textures were painted by my friend Denis.

If you want to run it through Unity, use version 2021.1.13f1.

If you want to play the game itself, use the latest release. 

You can also download the game from Itch.io and Gamejolt:
